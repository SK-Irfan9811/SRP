    </p><h1>Agricultural Land</h1>
    <b>Definition: </b>All ecosystems modified or created by man specifically to grow or raise biological products for human consumption or use.  This includes cropland, pasture, orchards, groves, vineyards, nurseries,  ornamental horticultural areas, and confined feeding areas.<p>

    </p><h2>Agricultural Land Categories: </h2><p>
    
    <b>Confined Feeding Operations</b>: Those ecosystems that are modified or created by man to serve as large, specialized livestock production enterprises in which large animal populations are restricted to relatively small areas.  This include beef cattle feedlots, dairy operations with confined feeding, large poultry farms, and hog feedlots.  This does not include shipping corrals and other temporary holding facilities.

    <b> Cropland and Pasture</b>: Those ecosystems that are modified or created by man to produce agricultural crops (e.g., corn, wheat, soybean) and/or to be used for pasture.  This includes harvested cropland, cultivated summer-fallow and idle cropland, land on which crop failure occurs, cropland in soil-improvement grasses and legumes, cropland used only for pasture in rotation with crops, and pasture on land more or less permanently used for that purpose.

    <b> Orchards and Vinyards</b>: Those ecosystems that are modified or created by man to produce the various fruit and nut crops.  This includes orchards, groves, vineyards, nurseries, and ornamental horticulture areas.  This includes floricultural and seed-and-sod areas and some greenhouses, as well as tree nurseries that provide seedlings for plantation forestry.

    <b> Other Agricultural Land</b>: Those ecosystems that are modified or created by man to produce food and fiber, but do not fall into the other categories of agricultural land (cropland and pasture; orchards, groves, vineyards, nurseries and ornamental horticultural areas; confined feeding operations).  This includes farmsteads, holdings for livestock such as corrals, breeding and training facilities on horse farms, farm lanes and roads, ditches and canals, small farm ponds, and similar uses.

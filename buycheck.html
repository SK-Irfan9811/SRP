<p>Buying agricultural land in India is undoubtedly the most sensible decision that you would ever make. After all, agricultural lands are much cheaper than lands in cities and urban developments, income from farm land is tax free, and you can expect good returns on investment when you sell it, especially if the land is located in an area where the government plans to bring up an infrastructural project in the near future.</p>

<p><b>Most state governments require you to be a farmer to buy agricultural land in India. Also, you must study the state by-laws carefully before investing in farm land to avoid any legal litigation later on. This article highlights various legal formalities that you must consider before making a purchase decision.</b></p>

<p>But, buying agricultural land in India is not as convenient as buying real estate in Mumbai, Pune, Bangalore, Ahmedabad, Delhi, or any other city for that matter. That’s because to buy agricultural land in India:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Almost all state governments, with exception to Telangana, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, require you (or your father or grandfather) to be a farmer.</p></li>
<li><p>If you or your forefathers are not farmers, you need to show that you already own some agricultural land</p></li>
<li><p>Under no circumstances can you convert fertile farm land into a residential development. You can use only dry agricultural land for that purpose.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>However, if you are able to override these limitations, buying farm land in India can be very a fruitful and promising decision.</p>

<p><b>Below are some of the points that you must consider while purchasing agricultural land in India:</b></p>

<h2>Verify the owner carefully</h2>

<p>Before finalizing the deal, you must carefully confirm if the person selling the land is the actual owner. The title deed of the property, Pattadar Pass Book, and 1B register confirm the owner’s name and also verify if he has absolute rights to sell the property. Also, get all the previous deeds examined by a lawyer to ensure that there are no land disputes or more than one owner of the land.</p>

<h2>Check land classification</h2>

<p>Many categories of land fall under prohibited purchase categories. Know land laws across India carefully. Also, check if the land that you wish to buy is clear of all such prohibitions. Under no circumstances you should consider investing into a land that is a Government property, forest land, or has been assigned to landless poor by the Government.</p>

<h2>Agreement or sales deed</h2>

<p>After verifying all the documents, get a detailed sales deed written with complete details of land, its boundaries, and name and address of the owner. Your agreement must be made by a lawyer, signed by both the parties, and duly signed by two witnesses too.</p>

<h2>Stamp duty and Registration of the land</h2>

<p>Stamp duties are government taxes that vary from state to state. Stamp duty on you land must be paid as it is a legal document and can be used in court as evidence. You must also get your land registered in the name of the owner within four months of date of purchase. You need to enclose the original sales deed, previous deed, if any, tax receipt as documents, and two witnesses must be present at the time of registration.</p>

<h2>Mutation</h2>

<p>Within 90 days from the date of registration, an application must be send to the Tehsildar in form 6A for making mutations in the land records. You must also seek Pattadar Pass Book and Title Deed from him.</p>

<h2>Survey of land</h2>

<p>Get the land surveyed by a recognized surveyor to ensure the measurements of the plot and its boundaries are as mentioned in the title certificate.</p>

<h2>Entry in Pahani/Adangal</h2>

<p>You must also get your land details entered in the Pahani/Adangal</p>

<h2>Obtain tax receipts and copies of land records</h2>

<p>Obtain all the latest land tax receipts and certified copies of Pahani/Adangal and 1B register for legal proof of purchase.</p>

<h2>Purchasing land from NRI owners</h2>

<p>You can buy farm land from NRI owners also. However, he must first authorize a third party to sell the land on his behalf. If you wish to purchase agricultural land from NRI owners, carefully check his power of attorney, duly signed by the Indian embassy within his province.</p>

<h2>Getting agricultural land converted into non-agricultural land</h2>

<p>For this, you need to submit an application to the concerned authorities, stating the reason for conversion. You must enclose all necessary documents, including sales deed, tax receipts, mutation letter as well as details stating the dimensions of the land. You must pay the fee applicable for land conversion and ensure that no litigation is pending.<p>

<p>Above all, whenever you plan to buy land in India, agricultural or non-agricultural, you must always seek help from India’s best real estate consultants who are fully aware of rules and regulations pertaining to real estate sale and purchase and can help you make a wise choice.<p>
<p>Land as a commodity has many uses and features. However, owning a plot of land brings with it a serious amount of paperwork and background checks. Legal formalities can be intimidating for some, but owning a managed farmland can be extremely rewarding and fulfilling once completed.</p>

<p>Here are some of the important considerations that the buyer must keep in mind before investing in farmland. </p>

<h2>Legal aspect of owning farmland</h2>
<p>Checking the title of farmland is fundamental compliance that must be completed before the purchase. It is important to ensure that there are no disputes over the title and the land area. Farmland title verification should date back to a minimum of 40 years from the date of purchase. Tracing ownership should always begin with probing into the earliest document recorded. This is vital unless you do not want to purchase a seemingly fertile land that is under dispute.</p>

<p>Below are some of the necessary documents involved in the process:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Check Encumbrance Certificate:</b>Before buying a plot, it is essential to confirm that the land is free from legal dues. This document is instrumental in knowing the encumbrances concerning the property for a specific duration.</p></li> 

<li><p><b>Property Tax Receipts and Bills:</b>It is recommended that you ask the seller for previous property tax receipts, along with other bills related to the plot. This will help you to avoid taxation issues in the future.</p></li> 

<li><p><b>RTC (Record of Rights, Tenancy and Cultivation):</b>RTC is an annual document that is very crucial in title verification. It discloses the ownership, possession, tenancy, soil type, number of trees on the land, and other details. It is advisable to procure the said document at least for 40 years from the date of purchase as it discloses the flow of ownership annually.</p></li> 
</ul>
<p>Index of land, Mutation Extract, Family Tree History, Patta Book, and Khata certificate are some other important documents involved in the process.</p>

<h2>Check your resources</h2>

<p>Water is one of the most crucial resources to consider before investing in farmland. Laws regarding water rights can be complex, and you need to ensure you understand your rights and usage before purchasing land. Check the water certificate, talk to the farmers and understand your water rights. Survey the area and make sure to check if you are legally eligible to irrigate from the nearby ponds, creeks, or wells. Additionally, make sure to check your water source for any contaminants and treatments, if required.</p> 

<h2>Have a goal </h2>

<p>When it comes to constructing a building or a home, we always approach an architect. The final drawings help us align the budget. When it comes to farmlands, the majority of people start their research only after buying the land. However, you must understand the nuances of farming before investing in farmland.</p>

<p><b>The know-how:</b>Have you ever wondered why most people give up on their desire to own farmland? Here are some of the major challenges in owning farmland.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Lack of time:</b>Investment in agricultural lands is usually a secondary investment for many owners who do not intend to undertake agriculture as a full-time activity. This can lead to zero returns for the investor.</p></li>  

<li><p><b>Lack of expertise:</b>Experienced farmers are unable to grow crops on their fertile land effectively. Thus, the probability of an inexperienced landowner growing a profitable yield is even less. Lack of expertise and non-sustainable methods can cause permanent damage to your agricultural land, thus rendering it infertile.</p></li> 

<li><p><b>Lack of manpower:</b>Getting skilled and trained labour for farming activities has become difficult nowadays. The mass exodus of people from rural to urban areas in search of employment has added to this issue. </p></li> 
</ul>
<h2>Opt for managed farmlands</h2>

<p>A managed farmland is a structure where individuals invest their money in a farm plot and see their assets grow without the hassles of having to manage them. Suppose you are an individual with a keen interest in owning farmland but have limited knowledge of farming due to various constraints. In that case, managed farmland can be a suitable option for you.</p>

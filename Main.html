    <p style="text-align: justify;font-weight: bolder;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;font-size: larger;">Seed is the basic and most critical input for sustainable agriculture.  The response of all other inputs depends on quality of seeds to a large extent.  It is estimated that the direct contribution of quality seed alone to the total production is about 15 â€“ 20% depending upon the crop and it can be further raised up to 45% with efficient management of other inputs. The developments in the seed industry in India, particularly in the last 30 years, are very significant. A major re-structuring of the seed industry by Government of India through the National Seed Project Phase-I (1977-78), Phase-II (1978-79) and Phase-III (1990-1991), was carried out, which strengthened the seed infrastructure that was most needed and relevant around those times.  This could be termed as a first turning point in shaping of an organized seed industry</p>
